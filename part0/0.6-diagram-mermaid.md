```mermaid

graph TD
    User["User"] -->|1| Input["Types into input field"]
    Input -->|2| State["React updates input state"]
    User -->|3| Click["Clicks 'Save' button"]
    Click -->|4| Handler["Event handler creates a new note object"]
    Handler -->|5| Notes["Note is added to notes array using setState"]

    React -->|7| Display["New note appears in the list"]



```

## Steps

1. The user types a note into the input field.  
2. React updates the component state on every keystroke.  
3. When the user clicks the "Save" button, the event handler runs.  
4. A new note object is created.  
5. The note is added to the notes array using setState.  
6. React re-renders the component.  
7. The new note appears in the list without reloading the page.
